    <h2>Planning a Tea Party</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Whether planning a tea party for two or for fifty-two, I have a few tips that will definitely help to make your event so very special. I wouldn’t call myself a tea party expert, but I sure have learned a thing or two while planning my older sister, Courtney’s, bridal tea shower. From picking a venue, to deciding on a menu, to ending the party with sweet favors for your guests, I’ve got you covered on all the tea party essentials.</p> 

    <p>1) The Venue <br>
    Picking the perfect venue is crucial for any event. Always consider your vision. For example, if you are planning a quaint tea party for your closest four girl friends, your backyard garden or patio would make for an excellent venue. More than four? Think outside of the box. Renting an elegant white tent to set up outdoors would be beautiful! For my sister’s bridal tea party, we are renting the outside patio of a local coffee shop. The patio is just enough room to set up six round tables that can accommodate up to ten guests each, while still creating that quiet, secret garden feel for our guests. 
    </p>
        
    <p>2) Invitations <br>
    The invitations are what get your guests excited for the event! Make sure that your invitations create the same feel that you want for your party. For an elegant tea party, consider elaborate invitations trimmed with lace. For a Persian themed tea, go with black, white, and pink invitations. An Eiffel Tower graphic or little poodle dog would help to create the perfect Paris-themed invitations. For my sister’s bridal tea shower, I wanted the invitations to be pretty, simple, and sweet. To be cost efficient since there were over 80 women invited, I contacted a graphic designer on Etsy who would create the invitation, send me the finalized pdf and then I would get the invitations printed and cut locally. This turned out to be a fantastic idea! The designer did an incredible job and I couldn’t have been happier with the results. To make the invitations even more special, I purchased a shimmery-pearl colored cardstock with matching envelopes from an online paper store (link below).  I had the invitations and envelopes printed at Target Copy and finished each invitation with the cutest teacup stamps from Zazzle.com. Overall, these invitations were exactly what I had envisioned and even fell within the budget! A total win-win.

    <p>3) Tea Cups, China & More <br>
    This is where I had to do my homework! Since the bridal tea party is being held outdoors at a local coffee shop, I had to have everything rented in. Tables, chairs, linens, napkins, teacups, water glasses, plates, silverware, and everything else you could possibly need. I definitely recommend setting up a meeting with your local party renter to discuss pricing and options. Jade at Party Time Rentals in Stuart, Florida has been doing an incredible job helping me to ensure that everything we could possibly need for the bridal tea is accounted for! To make our tea extra memorable, I wanted to add in a few special touches. I researched every vintage rental company in Florida and narrowed down based on location and pricing. Dishie Rentals out of Orlando, Florida has the most beautiful vintage teacups, saucers, and gold vintage flatware that will be so perfect for my sister’s bridal tea. Renting these out costs a little more than just renting the basics from any other party rental company but I really wanted to go the extra mile to make my sister’s day so memorable. I would recommend checking out local flea markets and buying a few tea cups of your own to have on hand for your next small tea party. It’s the little details that go the longest way!

    <p>4) The Menu <br>
    This past November I had the opportunity to fly out to NYC to visit one of my best high school friends. While my best friend was working, my sister and I went to afternoon tea at The Plaza Hotel. This tea served as great inspiration as I thought ahead to prepare the perfect tea party menu.  Scones are a must for any tea, served with the the essentials, clotted cream, jam or preserves, and lemon curd. Next, the finger sandwiches should be served. Cucumber and salmon are staples for a traditional afternoon tea but I would encourage you to get creative with different breads and fillings to craft the perfect menu for your tea. Grilled gouda cheese sandwiches, chicken salad sandwiches, roast beef and horseradish sauce, and pesto crostini’s just to get your mouth drooling. To finish off any tea party, little hand-held dessert bites will sure to be a hit. At The Plaza, we enjoyed cream puffs, mini cheesecakes, lemon tarts, black and white cookies, and lemon cakes to name a few. Whether you are preparing the menu for your tea party or your party is being catered, be sure to stick to the classics that your guests know and love but don’t be afraid to add your own twist on things with new ingredients or flavor combinations.

    <p>5) Favors <br>
    At a traditional party, guests should be thanked for attending by receiving a favor. This might not be necessary if your tea party is a small intimate gathering of your closest friends, but for anything larger, I definitely suggest that you send your guests out the door with something sweet for attending your event. Some ideas for favors that are sure to be a hit: fresh macarons, petit fours, vintage teacups, or a box of tea bags for your guest to enjoy later at home.

    <p>I hope I inspired you with a few ways to make your tea party a special event for you and your guests.</p>
